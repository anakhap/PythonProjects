# Recommendation System for Purchasing Items (for Customers)

## Summary

In this project, collaborative filtering is used with the cosine and pearson measure to compare the models with the baseline popularity model in order to make recommendations to customers.

Three sets of data are used: regular buying count, buying dummy, and normalized purchase frequency as the target variable.

Models are evaluated by RMSE, precision and recall in order to observe the impact of personalization.

Finally, the Cosine approach was selected using the dummy data as the best recommendation system model.
